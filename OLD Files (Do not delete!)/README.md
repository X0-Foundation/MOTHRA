# XContracts
the older version allows numerical processing errors accumulated over time.
The TGR contract maintain an important watchdog,
which watches for the difference between the collective true net amount of TGR and the marginal sum of all users' net TGR balances.
'net' tokens here means the total bookkept amount of tokens minus the amount of tokens pending burn.
why burn is pending? because burning occurs over time but burning cannot be executed on time, to save gas!!!
on-time burning would require to scan all (millions of) users to burn from each of them every 12 hours.
So, a virtual collective burn is managed every 12 hours, and individual users' burn will only be executed when we need.
Hence, there are distinctive concepts: collective burn and individual burn. The former is virtual.
My watchdog monitors the difference between the collective net value and the individual net value. They must be the same.
In the older version, the difference (error_rate) was acceptable small but increasing over time. This was due to the inherent numerical error of computer.
The new version invented a new algorithm, which solves the error problem completely.
While the whole crypto industry adopts the Pancakeswap (after Uniswap v2)'s technique of managing accumulated amount, to me it turns out to be a linear model.
But your model is different: you want to burn some percent periodically, not an amount. This is a non-linear model.
A series of amounts can grow to any sum, but a series of a percent cannot grow to the given sum. You cannot burn more than actual amount after all.
I invented this algorithm in the new version: It can be business-licensed.

The new version now produce virtually no error.
The watchdog reports, after running dozens of transactions, only 0 trillion-ths of error_rate.
The absolute error is normally zero gway, some times one or two grway.
The new version is equipped with safety mechanism for numerical errors:
The whole system will stuck, freezing users' precious assets in the blockchain, if there is a negative amount, however small it is. Terrible.
I added safety mechanism that prevents a negative amount from happening, at the small expense of gas fee.

The off-chain side has no longer to make an on-chain call to burn assets periodically.
I created a new algorithm that frees the on-chain system from having to rely on the, small yet existing, uncertainty of off-chain part.

The new technique was demonstrated with periodic burning of users' tgr tokens.
The technique can be applied to periodic burning of tokens used for voting.
Periodic diluting tgr/ftm liquidity for the purpose of generating htz rewards, is an exception.

There is no free lunch. This elegant freedom is at an expense of a bit increased gas spending for user calls.

This is a complete new approach, industry-wide, to handle with periodic maintenance of smart contracts, for the burning aspect.

Specifically, periodic burning is free from periodic maintenance call.

This algorithm assumes the following:
burning rate is less than 1% every round/period. Xavier's burning rate is 0.777% every 24 hours.
There will be a maximum of 10,000 rounds. This is equivalent to over 27 years if a round/period is 24 hours.
The maximum supply of TGR token is a quadrillion ( = a million billions ).
There is no limit of the number of users.
Pls check if these assumptions are acceptable,

Different combinations of limits are also possible.
